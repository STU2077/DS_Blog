<h2>Installation</h2>
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

<h2>Project Motivation</h2>
Due to Covid-19 outbreak, tourism, hospitality, and real estate industries were struggled.
In order to stimulate the economy, AU government offered great benefits for property investors. I am interested to find out insights to support an investing idea through the Melbourneâ€™s Airbnb data. There are four questions I am expecting to find answers:

Q1: How is the rental market performing in Melbourne on Airbnb?
Q2: What areas have a greater chance to rend out properties?
Q3: What type of property should I invest in?
Q4: How do price and review scores affect rental properties?

<h2>File Descriptions</h2>
A notebook is available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Each cell has a sentence at the top for describing the purpose of the code.


Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here.
