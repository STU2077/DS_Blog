# DS_Blog
This is my first project on Udacity.
The project is about finding insights from Melbourne Airbnb Data.
Business Questions:
1. The trend of availability:
Which month has the highest/lowest rental rate?
What are the most/least properties?
2. The trend of rental price by property type:
What is the rental price distribution?
3. the correlation among price and scores
4. What are the effects that Covid-19 brings to Melbourne?
